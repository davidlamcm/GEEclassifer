# GEEclassifer
repo for dissertation

# Timeline
    - targeted submission date : Summer Semester, 2017-18 ie. Jun 2018
    - 6 months to go
    - frist draft target in 3.5 months time?
    - 1.5 month data collections + labeling + research 
    - 1 month training / tuning
    - 1 month writing report


# Problems to be solved 
    - not enough data
        - transfer learning 
            - find suitable pretrain model 
                - similar statelite dataset
    - download picture 
        - GEE sample scripts 
            - define areas/resolutions/layers 
                - store and crops 
    - image size in prediction vs traning with labels can be different?
